# Scenario â€” Current-State IAM Deployment (StartupCo)


## Client Background

You are a Cloud Engineer Consultant, working with StartupCo, a fast-growing tech startup that recently launched their first product - a fitness tracking application.
They've been using AWS for three months, initially setting up their infrastructure quickly to meet launch deadlines.
Now that their product is live, they need to address their cloud security fundamentals.  The company has 10 employees who all currently share the AWS root account credentials to access and manage their cloud resources.
This practice started when they were moving quickly to launch, but now their CTO recognizes the security risks this poses.>

---

**Objective**  
Create a detailed, current-state AWS architecture diagram that reflects infrastructure and security posture with clear visuals and annotations.

---

## Current Setup (call out explicitly)
- Work is performed from the **AWS root account**.  
- **No role/permission separation** between teams.  
- **MFA** and **password policies** are **not enabled**.  
- **AWS credentials are shared** in team chat.  

**Action:** Summarize what this implies for the organization (risks, gaps, priority fixes).

---

## Current Infrastructure (visual components)
- **EC2** instances running the application (show multiple instances in **Dev** and **Prod**).  
- **S3** buckets for user data and application assets.  
- **RDS** for user information.  
- **CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging.  
- Clearly **separate Dev vs. Prod** environments.

---

## Team Structure & Access Needs (annotate on the diagram)
- **4 Developers:** EC2 and S3 access.  
- **2 Operations:** Full infrastructure access.  
- **1 Finance Manager:** Billing and cost-management access.  
- **3 Data Analysts:** Read-only access to data resources.

---

## Diagram Guidance
- Use standard AWS icons; label **data flows** (dotted lines) and **dependencies** (arrows).  
- Include **trust boundaries**, clear labels, and a **legend** for team access roles.  
- Place annotations directly on the diagram and keep **Dev** and **Prod** visually separated.
